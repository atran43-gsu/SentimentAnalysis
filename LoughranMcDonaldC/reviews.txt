I had big expectations because I love English TV, in particular Investigative and detective stuff but this guy is really boring. It didn't appeal to me at all.
I highly recommend this series. It is a must for anyone who is yearning to watch \"grown up\" television. Complex characters and plots to keep one totally involved. Thank you Amazin Prime.
This one is a real snoozer. Don't believe anything you read or hear, it's awful. I had no idea what the title means. Neither will you.
Mysteries are interesting.  The tension between Robson and the tall blond is good but not always believable.  She often seemed uncomfortable.
This show always is excellent, as far as british crime or mystery showsgoes this is one of the best ever made.  The stories are well done and the acting is top notch with interesting twists in the realistic and brutal storylines.  This show pulls no punches as it enters into the twisted minds of criminals and the profiler psychiatrist who helps out in a northern english city police force. The show looks like it is shot in Manchester but it is called by another name in the show.  One episode is not on this disc the excellent 'prayer of the bone\" which is on a seperate disc.  Still crime shows don't get much better than this one on either side of the ocean.  It's just a great show that never has had a less than well made episode. Unfortunately like all British shows you only get about five shows a year ,  but these are an hour and a half shows , still one could hope for at least 8 of these a year.  The realism and depth of the main character Tony Hill as protrayed by the excellent Robson Green is well worth viewing because he just makes this role truly part of himself in everyway.  I bet he went to crime scenes even in real life to research his role.  But the writers too must be applauded for their way above average stories.  Lets hope this show continues on for many years to come.
